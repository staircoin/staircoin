- This is Stair coin Spec.

- <Technical Specs>
- Algorithm : x11 (Only for the premine)
- Symbol : STAIR
- Type : POW(Until Block 500) / POS (After Block 501) / MN
- Max supply : 200,000,000 
- Block : 60 sec
- Staking time : 6hrs
- Masternode collateral (70% MN / 30% POS)
-         Phase 1 : 1,000 STAIR (After Block 4,321)
-         Phase 2 : 5,000 STAIR (After Block 14,402)
-         Phase 3 : 10,000 STAIR (After Block 24,483)
-         Phase 4 : 20,000 STAIR (After Block 34,564)
-         Phase 5 : 50,000 STAIR (After Block 44,645)
- Premine : 1,000,000 STAIR (50% Exchange listing & development, 50% Airdrop and bounties, and Marketing)

- Block 1 =pre-mine
- 2 - 4,320 = 0.4 STAIR (3day)
- 4,321 - 14,401 = 20 STAIR (7day) Phase 1 (after presale ROI 24528% / total 30MN)
- 14,402 - 24,482 = 60 STAIR (17day) Phase 2 (Expected ROI 15768% / total 28-30MN)
- 24,483 - 34,563 = 120 STAIR (24day) Phase 3 (Expected ROI 11618% / total 38-40MN)
- 34,564 - 44,644 = 200 STAIR (31day) Phase 4 (Expected ROI 9560% / total 40-42MN)
- 44,645 - 1,000,000 = 300 STAIR (39day) Phase 5 (Expected ROI 8830% / total 25MN)
- 1,000,001 -  = 200 STAIR
